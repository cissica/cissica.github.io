I actually starting learning very simple code in high school and originally thought it would be too complicated and boring for me, to be honest. But wow was I wrong! by the end of my coding expirience in high school and taking 3rd place in an app building competition. I knew that I wanted to code for a living. AND so I went down a rabbit hole of research into all the possibilities and wonders of where coding can lead and why it could be a great career choice. 

I came here today to give you 100 (give or take a couple hundred) reasons why I decided to learn software development and the money ainâ€™t one of them (don't get me wrong the pay is V E R Y reasonable) okay enough chitter chatter lets talk sofware development and why it is the way to go for me. 

1. It is *i m p o r t a n t e* or Important for the non spanish speaking.
Well why is it important? Well let's see...
We need it! it is a part of most if not all industries, small businesses, medium businesses, big businesses, heart          shaped, you name it and code is in there somewhere, somehow. From websites to vending machines. 
2. It is *c r e a t i v e*
Have you ever seen a digital sign that is so visually pleasing you can't look away? no? just me? or an incredibly effortless aestheticly pleasing app? or an addicting HD video game? Behing these things are a group of incredibly creative people who are masters at problem solving in the most seamless and creative way possible. 
3. It is *c h a l l e n g i n g*. Now why in the world is that a good thing? 
Well it's suprisingly motivating to have a job that is motivating. For me personally, this reason is my favorite. Being challenged gives me a sense of purpose. If I am engaged and invested into my role doing something I like to do and I am good at it. Well, that is fullfiling. 
4. It is a constant *l e a r n i n g   c u r v e*. This industry is forever changing and expanding. 
And this is a good thing because?.... that means, the importance never stops, the creativity or fun never come stop, and  the challenges keep on coming. The learning curve doesn't leave room for boredom. ![](http://)

In conclusion learning software development leads to great earing potential, the demand for it is strong, it gives new perspective to problem solving, it offers career flexibility and can open up new areas of opportunity, etc. which is why I decided to learn software development.
